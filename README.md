# Disease Prediction System

## Project Overview

 This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict diseases based on user-provided symptoms. By integrating various classification algorithms, the system delivers accurate and reliable predictions from a comprehensive dataset.

## Key Features

- **Predictive Modeling**: Employs Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Random Forest algorithms.
- **Ensemble Approach**: Combines predictions from multiple models to enhance accuracy.
- **Interactive Prediction**: Allows users to predict diseases based on input symptoms.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Provides accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, and detailed classification reports.

## Usage

1. **Load Your Data**
   - Import your dataset and prepare it for training and testing.

2. **Train Models**
   - Fit the SVM, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest models with your data.

3. **Make Predictions**
   - Use the trained models to predict diseases from new symptoms.

4. **Evaluate Performance**
   - Analyze the modelsâ€™ performance with accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, and classification reports.

## Models

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful classifier known for high accuracy.
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic model effective for disease prediction.
